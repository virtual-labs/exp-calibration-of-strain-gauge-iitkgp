### About the Experiment

Strain gauges are widely used instruments for measuring mechanical deformation or strain in materials. When external forces are applied to a stationary object, stress and strain are the result. A Strain gauge is basically a sensor whose resistance varies with applied force. It converts force, pressure, tension, weight etc., into a change in electrical resistance which can then be measured.
